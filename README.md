# EmberConf Chat

This is a demonstration application to accompany my talk entitled "Building Real-time Applications in Ember", which I will be giving on March 4, 2015 at [EmberConf][] in Portland, Oregon.

This project relies on [stevekinney/socketry-server][server] and is loosely based on [stevekinney/socketry-client][client], which I used in an earlier version of this talk given at [Denver Ember.js in November of 2014][denver].
